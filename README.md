# Phase 3 Code Challenge: Product Reviews

For this assignment, I'll be working with an e-commerce domain and focusing on the product reviews.

The challenge has 3 models: `User`, `Review`, and `Product`.

A `Product` has many `User`s, a `User` has many `Products`s and a `Review` belongs to a `User` and to a `Product`.

`Product` - `User` is a many to many relationship.


## Deliverables

To get started, run `bundle install`.

To test this code it, run `rake console` from the command line. This will start a `pry` session with
your classes defined. 

You can test out the methods that you write here. Use the `seeds.rb` file to create sample data and to test your
models and associations.


### Migrations


- A `Review` belongs to a `Product`, and a `Review` also belongs to a `User`. This means our 
reviews table has a product id and user id
- The `reviews` table should also have:
  - A `star_rating` column that stores an integer.
  - A `comment` column that stores a string.



### Object Association Methods

#### Review

- `Review#user`
  - returns the `User` instance for this Review
- `Review#product`
  - returns the `Product` instance for this Review

#### Product

- `Product#reviews`
  - returns a collection of all the Reviews for the Product
- `Product#users`
  - returns a collection of all the Users who reviewed the Product

#### User

- `User#reviews`
  - returns a collection of all the Reviews that the User has given
- `User#products`
  - returns a collection of all the Products that the User has reviewed

Use `rake console` and check that these methods work before proceeding. For
example, you should be able to call `User.first.products` and see a list of the
products for the first user in the database based on your seed data; and
`Review.first.user` should return the user for the first review in the database.

### Aggregate and Association Methods

#### Review

- `Review#print_review`
  - should `puts` to the terminal a string formatted as follows: `Review for {insert product name} by {insert user name}: {insert review star_rating}. {insert review comment}`

#### Product

- `Product#leave_review(user, star_rating, comment)`
  - takes a `User` (an instance of the `User` class), a `star_rating` (integer), and a `comment` (string) as arguments, and creates a new `Review` in the database associated with this Product and the User
- `Product#print_all_reviews`
  - should `puts` to the terminal a string representing each review for this product
  - each review should be formatted as follows: `Review for {insert product name} by {insert user name}: {insert review star_rating}. {insert review comment}`
- `Product#average_rating`
  - returns a `float` representing the average star rating for all reviews for this product

#### User

- `User#favorite_product`
  - returns the product instance that has the highest star rating from this user
- `User#remove_reviews(product)`
  - takes a `Product` (an instance of the `Product` class) and removes _all_ of this user's reviews for that product
  - you will have to delete any rows from the `reviews` table associated with this user and the product
